# Options-Strategy-Builder-Java-Project

Problem Statement :
It is risky to trade in derivatives of Stocks without quantitative analysis therefore there are
tools available that can simplify the task. For example, modern hardware can take care of
the fairly complex mathematics required to calculate the fair value of an option. To trade
options successfully, investors must have a thorough understanding of the potential profit
and risk for any trade they are considering. For this, the main tool option traders use is
called a risk graph. The risk graph, often called a "profit/loss diagram," provides an easy
way to understand the effect of what may happen to an option or any complex option
position in the future.


Objective :
The main objective of this project is to provide assistance to all the users who want to
build payoff charts on their own strategies. It also helps the user to calculate Option Price and
also compute Option Greeks. User will have the advantage to buy/sell the option if the option
price for the given strike is undervalued in the live market.

Methodology :
This project uses Java Swing which provides GUI and hence easy for the user to interact
with the interface. This project uses database to store all data and information. This project
also uses Java fx hence making it user friendly. The user can analyse all the fair values of the
required strike in option chain and also plot payoff chart trade quantitatively. User can also
keep a track on his/her Stock portfolio.
